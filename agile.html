    <h2>Agile Methodology</h2>
    <p>The Agile Method is a particular approach to project management that is utilized in software development.
       This method assists teams in responding to the unpredictability of constructing software.
       It uses incremental, iterative work sequences that are commonly known as sprints.
       A sprint is a period of time allocated for a particular phase of a project.
       Sprints are considered to be complete when the time period expires.
       There may be disagreements among the members of the team as to whether or not the development is
       satisfactory; however, there will be no more work on that particular phase of the project.
       The remaining phases of the project will continue to develop within their respective time frames.</p>
