    <h2>Extreme Programming</h2>
    <p>A discipline of software development that follows a specific structure that is designed to simplify and expedite the process of developing new software. Kent Beck developed Extreme Programming to be used with small teams of developers who need to develop software quickly in an environment of rapidly-changing requirements.
       XP teams design software for specific functionalities without adding any functionalities that are not specifically requested that may slow down the process, keeping the development course simple through systematic and regular testing and design improvements.
       Extreme Programming is based on 12 principles: The planning process, Small releases, Metaphor, Simple design, Testing, Refactoring, Pair Programming, Collective Ownership, Continuous Integration, 40-hour week, co-habitation and code efficiency.
